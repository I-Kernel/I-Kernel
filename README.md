## Introduction

Bio-inspired algorithms offer powerful solutions to complex problems by mimicking natural processes. BioAI Frameworks aims to make these algorithms more accessible to researchers, developers, and students by providing a flexible and well-documented platform for experimentation and development.

This framework is designed with modularity in mind, allowing users to easily integrate new algorithms and customize existing ones. It's also built to be compatible with popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications.

## Features

*   **Modular Design:** Easily add, remove, or modify algorithms and components.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Clear and concise documentation to guide users through the framework.
*   **Extensive Algorithm Library:** A growing collection of bio-inspired algorithms.
*   **Integration with ML Libraries:** Seamless integration with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other popular machine learning libraries.
*   **Easy to Use:** Simple API for quick prototyping and experimentation.

## Installation

To install BioAI Frameworks, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install bioai-frameworks
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/I-Kernel/bioai-frameworks.git
cd bioai-frameworks
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the Genetic Algorithm in BioAI Frameworks:

```python
from bioai_frameworks.algorithms import GeneticAlgorithm

# Define your fitness function
def fitness_function(individual):
    return sum(individual)

# Initialize the Genetic Algorithm
ga = GeneticAlgorithm(
    population_size=100,
    gene_length=10,
    fitness_function=fitness_function,
    mutation_rate=0.01
)

# Run the algorithm
best_individual = ga.run(generations=100)

print("Best individual:", best_individual)
```

## Algorithms Implemented

BioAI Frameworks currently includes implementations of the following algorithms:

*   **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**
*   **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
*   **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**
*   **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**

More algorithms are planned for future releases.
